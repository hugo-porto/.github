# Hugo Porto

Hugo Porto is a personal portfolio theme for Hugo. It features a minimalist design that focuses on showcasing your
projects and achievements. This theme is perfect for developers, designers, and creatives who want to create a simple
yet powerful online portfolio.

I decided to build a new Hugo theme from scratch to ensure that I have complete freedom in my work and avoid any
limitations. The project is licensed under the MIT license, so you can use it for personal and commercial projects
without any issues.

Sincerelly, Andrew Molyuk
