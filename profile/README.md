# Hugo Porto

Hugo Porto is a personal portfolio theme for Hugo. It features a minimalist design that focuses on showcasing your
projects and achievements. This theme is perfect for developers, designers, and creatives who want to create a simple
yet powerful online portfolio.

I decided to remove all code of the original [Porto](https://boxmodel.dev/templates/porto/html) website template due to
licensing issues. The owner changed the license from license-free to MPL 2.0 with additional restrictions.

I decided to build a new Hugo theme from scratch to ensure that I have complete freedom in my work and avoid any
limitations.

Sincerelly, Andrew Molyuk
