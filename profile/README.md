# hugo-porto theme

Hugo-Porto is a minimal personal portfolio theme for Hugo that focuses on showcasing projects and achievements. It's ideal for developers, designers, and other creatives who want a simple, fast online portfolio.

We built this theme from scratch to keep the design and implementation flexible. The project is released under the MIT License and may be used in personal or commercial projects.

We follow high code-quality standards: automated linters, formatters, and continuous integration checks help keep the codebase consistent, well-tested, and maintainable.

If you have questions or suggestions, please open an issue or contact us.

We appreciate your feedback and contributions and hope you enjoy the theme!
