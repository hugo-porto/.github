# Hugo Porto

Hugo Porto is a personal portfolio theme for Hugo. It features a minimalist design that focuses on showcasing your
projects and achievements. This theme is perfect for developers, designers, and creatives who want to create a simple
yet powerful online portfolio.

The theme was inspired and based originally on the [Porto](https://boxmodel.dev/templates/porto/html) theme from
[BoxModelDev](https://boxmodel.dev/)'s guys.

The repository structure outlined below sets up the necessary components for the Hugo Porto theme. Each repository
serves a specific purpose:

- `.github`: Contains GitHub-related files for the project.
- `docs`: Houses the documentation for the project.
- `theme`: The main hugo-theme repository.
