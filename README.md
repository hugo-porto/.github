[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fe4b51f393984ac5b939ad1dde19ba0a)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/hugo-porto/.github/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

This repository provides the organization's default community files (for example `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`). When a repository in the organization doesn't include its own README or contributing guide, GitHub will display the defaults from this repository.

The file `profile/README.md` is shown on the organization's public profile. Feel free to add or update helpful information there.

This repository also includes a VS Code workspace file, `hugo-porto.code-workspace`, with recommended editor settings and workspace-level configuration â€” open it in VS Code to apply those settings automatically.
